The armor display is now a seperate plug because I noticed from some posts on the EVO Board that not everyone wanted this feature, especcialy during the mission for the Voinian Dreadnought. I've added  an EVO icon so that when Command-Q is pressed the EVO icon appears instead of the EV one.

This doesn't interfere with the game at all just makes it a little more fun to play.\r\nHyper UltraBuster -- same as the last, but makes jumps even faster.\r\nFE missions to mission computer -- puts Frontier Express missions on the mission computer. I don't like them coming up in the spaceport bar\r\nFaster Fuel Recharge -- I hate waiting around for fuel scoops to recharge I don't think the delay adds much to the game. This will make them go a little faster.\r\nHector Payback -- I don't really condone not paying shareware fees, but this adds cheat missions available at Earth so you can get back the money that Captain Hector steals from you. It sucks having to postpone a big purchase because of a Hector theft. Just take off and land and you'll get the money it says.\r\nSmall Pictures -- for plugin developers, this may save you ten minutes in editing EVO and EV outfits or making them available in other plugins.
