This plug includes the resources from SW20 1.0, SW20 1.03 fix, \u00a5Extra Ships\u00c4 v.2, \u00a5OExtra Ships, Extra Ships Cheat and SW202 cheat.  The cheat resources were added last to ensure that their data was not overwritten, so this is the cheat version of the plug.  I have made no changes to the original resources other than to copy them all into one big plug and have tested it for a long time without any mishaps.

Also ever noticed that in the shipyard pic that the Voinian Cargo ship has two turrets on it but you only get one when you buy it? Well now it has two so it is actually the ship you see in the pic. The armor display is now a seperate plug because I noticed from some posts on the EVO Board that not everyone wanted this feature, especcialy during the mission for the Voinian Dreadnought. I've added  an EVO icon so that when Command-Q is pressed the EVO icon appears instead of the EV one.

I admire the craftsmanship and creativity of many plug designers and would like to be able to use each of their plugs all the time, but conflicts inevitably preclude this possibility. So I chose a few of my favorites and assigned new resource IDs to cut-and-paste those favorites into my Voinian War plug to enhance gameplay. Most of the features in this plug are not my work, but the labors of others. I simply brought several of the best together into one package so that the EVO community could enjoy the benefits of many great plug designers simultaneously without problems. I love the result and I know that you will also.

This doesn't interfere with the game at all just makes it a little more fun to play.\r\nHyper UltraBuster -- same as the last, but makes jumps even faster.\r\nFE missions to mission computer -- puts Frontier Express missions on the mission computer. I don't like them coming up in the spaceport bar\r\nFaster Fuel Recharge -- I hate waiting around for fuel scoops to recharge I don't think the delay adds much to the game. This will make them go a little faster.\r\nHector Payback -- I don't really condone not paying shareware fees, but this adds cheat missions available at Earth so you can get back the money that Captain Hector steals from you. It sucks having to postpone a big purchase because of a Hector theft. Just take off and land and you'll get the money it says.\r\nSmall Pictures -- for plugin developers, this may save you ten minutes in editing EVO and EV outfits or making them available in other plugins.
