It should of been pretty obvious to what I missed-out. I'd just like to say that I have now corrected the omission, and that the guide is now complete! In this version I have created the final 4 levels to the HarryWorld (levels 12-15). I have NOT created any screenshots for these levels though, simply because I had decided a long time ago that I would actually realease a (v.4), which would slightly update every single level! Now, what would be the point of creating, or even having screenshots, that wouldn't be entirely accurate? I have not added any more Extras, but I have go a couple more ideas for these when (v.4) is released. (v.4) will also have imported MIDI files, for the levels that have currently not got a MIDI of their own (levels 1,4,6,10,12,14  15). The MIDI files currently imported for levels 2 ( 13) and 9 will also be updated, to a slightly more 'jazzed-up' version of the allotted tunes! For (v.4) I will also update the read-me file from a 'SimpleText' document, to a 'DOCMaker' document, which has be proven to be capable of havving a lot more text imputted into it than SimpleText! It can also be useful to people who just may not have access to SimpleText, but where DOCMaker is concerned, it seems that any documents made with it can be read, even if the reader doesn't have DOCMaker installed on their computer! I have also decided to 're-word' my speech slightly. For Example, I have usally called a graphic of which Harry can fall down a 'drop-zone', but in the editor, it is referred to as an 'empty space', and so, I will use that speech. Another example would be calling something that appears after an enemy has been destroyed an 'aftermath', of which I have decided isn't particually accurate in meaning, so that action will now be referred to as 're-spawn'. Finally, don't expect to see an update guide in (v.4), because I would have updated SO MANY things - including all of the scrolling-texts (which will be made longer, written in a clearer font, and will reveal any previous 'hidden' plot-points) - I would expect the player to start all the way back in level 01, simply to get the FULL EXPERIENCE of my first ever released HarryWorld - SwivelWorld[TM].
