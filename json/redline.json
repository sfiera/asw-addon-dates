It was unveiled in January 1995, at the Detroit Auto Show as \"the world's mightiest supercar\". Claimed performance included a top speed close to 250 mph (402 km/h) from a 720 hp (537 kW) quad-turbocharged V12 engine, the exhaust of which was claimed to be hot enough to damage the body panels, requiring ceramic tiles similar to those on the space shuttle to prevent this.\r\nThe mid-engined car was a spiritual successor to the Ford GT40, taking from it some styling cues, such as doors that cut into the roofline, but little else. All angles and glass, the Ford GT90 was the first Ford to display the company's \"New Edge\" design philosophy. The GT90 was built around a honeycomb-section aluminum monocoque and its body panels were moulded from carbon fiber.\r\nThe GT90 was built by a small team in just over six months and, as a result, borrowed many components from another high profile stablemate\u0097the Jaguar XJ220. The all-round double wishbone suspension and the five-speed manual gearbox came from the Jaguar, while the engine was from another member of the Ford family.\r\nThe GT90's 48-valve V12 was a six-litre engine which, if Ford had ever produced it in volume, might have produced up to 720 hp (537 kW), thanks to four Garrett Systems T2 turbochargers. The engine was based on the Ford Modular engine. Two V8 engines each had portions removed, and the cut down engines were welded together. In total, this yielded a 90-degree V-12, with 90.2 mm bore and 77.3 mm stroke. After being sold, an LS1 was placed in the vehicle.\r\nThen Ford CEO Jacques Nasser was very proud of the car, and kept a model of it on his desk.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to the DC Cars team\r\nThanks to DannyL for his help in testing and debugging and for creating the custom wheels used.\r\nThe model was created and mapped by Tyranitar.\r\nAdditional thanks goes to General Antilles and the members of the Redline Ambrosia forums who's harsh criticisms that really helped make this car great.  \r\n\r\nThis is one wicked fast ride, so have fun."}, "2995": {"title": "RLPDCruiserv2", "category": "Cars", "author": "Anonymous", "date": "06/09/2007", "size": "3.20 MB", "votes": 9, "stars": 3.5555549999999996, "downloads": 2440, "identifier": 2995, "filepath": "Cars/2995_RLPDCruiserv2.zip", "description": "2.0 replaces all previous versions of the RLPD Cruiser (both on the addons page and in your pluggins folder) and is compatable with versions 1.0.1 onward.

It was manufactured by Vector Aeromotive (see Vector Supercars), and was designed by Gerald Wiegert, and David Kostka. The newest, and most advanced methods of manufacture were used in building the W8s, justifying the name \"Aeromotive Engineering.\" Group C racing technology came into play with the aluminum honeycomb semi-monicoque, and roughly 5,000 aircraft specification rivets. Everything on the Vector was designed to last the life of the owner, given that the owner maintained the vehicle. The body was made largely of lightweight carbon kevlar, known for its strength, and lightness. Just 22 W8s were produced (17 customer cars and two pre-production cars, the prototype W2, and two prototype Avtech WX-3 with a mock up of the 7.0 liter DOHC TT engine evolution), the car retailing for up to 455,000 USD new (on today's used market they are available from less than 200,000, to well over 1,000,000)\r\nThe car was based around a Rodeck resleevable V8 engine racing engine, coupled to a three-speed B+M modified transmission. The engine had twin turbochargers, which produced an advertised 625\u00a0hp (634\u00a0PS/466\u00a0kW) at 5700\u00a0rpm and 834\u00a0N\u00b7m (650\u00a0ft\u00b7lbf) of torque. The W8 had an estimated top speed of 200+\u00a0mph (338\u00a0km/h). However, in testing at the Bonneville Salt Flats, the W-2 reached 242 mph (389 km/h) with the less powerful Donovan block as reported by Top Wheels magazine. This was reached while still using the \"high downforce\" wing. Later aerodynamic testing further honed efficiancy bringing Cd. down to just .32 prior to DOT crash testing in Ann Arbor, MI. Some may notice the subtle changes to the body from the first car, through the later cars. These include the elimination of some gills, a lower front facia, and air splitter, revised rear wing, mirror intakes, and front grill. All in all, this lead to substantial downforce without needing the W-2's massive rear wing. Evidence of the aerodynamic capablities exsist today, as seen on a video on Jabbasworld, Youtube, and Nthimage. After the top speed testing was completed, no more Vector W8's were fitted with a removable glass roof, as buffeting occurred at those extreme speeds.\r\nThe W8 was essentially an upgrade of the same company's earlier prototype, the Vector W2. Among the famous customers for the car was tennis star Andre Agassi, who had his car delivered for his birthday party. Late that night, he had an infamous incident when his car locked up, and spun during excessive speeds without all the necessary radiators installed. He was half way from his home towared Las Vegas. Vector claims that this is because he demended for his car before it could be finished, and he ignored their recommendations not to drive it until they could do the final work.[citation needed] Vector intended to follow the W8 with the Vector WX-3 and Vector WX-3R, but series production never got off the ground. Production of the W8 ended in 1993, when the company was illegally taken over by Megatech, but Wiegert won back the design copyrights, equipment, and remaining unsold cars, including the car in a VW museum in Germany.\r\nA red W8 made a rare appearance in the 1993 movie Rising Sun starring Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes. The car was owned by the character Eddie.\r\n\r\nModel created by Tyranitar\r\nTexture Mapping by Tyranitar\r\nCar File by Tyranitar\r\nWheels by Danny L\r\nSpecial Thanks to DC Cars for their help and Support\r\nSpecial Thanks to the Beta Testers\r\nSpecial Thanks to General Antilles who sets a very high par\r\nNo thanks to the idiot who decided to put a 3 speed in this thing\r\n"}, "3042": {"title": "SmugglersRun.redplug", "category": "Tracks", "author": "Anonymous", "date": "11/26/2006", "size": "380.00 kB", "votes": 10, "stars": 3.5, "downloads": 3753, "identifier": 3042, "filepath": "Tracks/3042_SmugglersRun.redplug.zip", "description": "SmugglersRun is a simple yet challenging track designed for Smuggler racing.\r\nThe goal was to provide an even playing field for Vettes and Minis:\r\nNice stretches, twisting tunnels, bumpy curves, and two pits for Minis to escape to.\r\nThe map overlay has been omitted to further offset the Vette's advantage.\r\n(AI Vettes and AI Minis usually finish in a dead heat)\r\n\r\nVersion 1.6 11/26/06\r\nSubmitted by HenryK and RM"}, "2971": {"title": "gcw-radical-sr4-v1.2", "category": "Cars", "author": "Anonymous", "date": "02/13/2007", "size": "1.10 MB", "votes": 8, "stars": 3.5, "downloads": 2938, "identifier": 2971, "filepath": "Cars/2971_gcw-radical-sr4-v1.2.zip", "description": "The Radical SR4.

The engine was reworked for higher revving, and although the official specs are the same as the normal Carrera, anecdotal evidence suggests a slightly higher output. It also had better suspension components. This release tries to emulate the real car in every way possible, with educated guesses at some specs.
