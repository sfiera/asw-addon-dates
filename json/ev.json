Tiring of the increasingly dangerous life of a merchant trader, you decide to abandon the world of legitimate business and forge your own path to glory.  The game can be played from the viewpoint of three very different perspectives: an association with the upstart Serpens Triumvirate the thankless task of an intergalactic bounty hunter, or an allegiance with the mysterious Mafia. This will be a galaxy in which you will have a multitude of enemies and precious few friends... though who can you really trust, for in a time of near anarchy and golden opportunity, friendship and comradery are the rarest of all commodities.  This plug offers more than 200 original missions, a multitude of new weapons and outfits, over 100 new worlds and systems and more than 40 new and altered ships, including seven formidable \"bosses\".

Forced into retreat, surrounded and fighting for its very survival, the rebellious Weave Alliance has been quietly establishing relations with the Saa'rel Union, a pacifist society of remarkable technological prowess.  Efforts are being made by The Weave to convince the Saa'rellians of the very real danger posed by Empire annexation, and perhaps gain a much needed ally in return.  Realising the possible threat of any such union and encouraged by the discovery of a mysterious artifact, the Empire's dark agents are secretly attempting to make first contact with a mythical, ancient race of unimaginable power with the intention of forming an alliance of its own, thus countering any possible future Weave insurgency.  However, little does the Empire's fanatical Central Command realise what they are about to unleash on an unsuspecting - and unprepared - universe.

They said that they were flying a Crecent Warship (Kestral), and they were caught off-guard and destroyed by 5 Kraits (defenders with the speed of a Rapier). The other major thing was the ships were programmed to recognise the Monty Python, and they won't fall for it as easily.
